## Design Thinking

Before coding, commit to a BOLD aesthetic direction:
- **Purpose**: What problem does this solve? Who uses it?
- **Tone**: Pick an extreme: brutally minimal, maximalist, retro-futuristic, organic, luxury, playful, editorial, brutalist, art deco, soft/pastel, industrial
- **Differentiation**: What makes this UNFORGETTABLE?

## Guidelines

**Typography**: Choose distinctive fonts. Avoid generic (Arial, Inter). Pair display font with refined body font.

**Color**: Commit to cohesive aesthetic. Use CSS variables. Dominant colors with sharp accents.

**Motion**: Animations for micro-interactions. CSS-only for HTML. Staggered reveals, scroll-triggering, surprising hover states.

**Spatial**: Unexpected layouts. Asymmetry. Overlap. Grid-breaking. Generous negative space OR controlled density.

**Backgrounds**: Create atmosphere - gradient meshes, noise textures, geometric patterns, layered transparencies, dramatic shadows.

## NEVER
- Generic fonts (Inter, Roboto, Arial)
- Cliched purple gradients on white
- Predictable layouts
- Cookie-cutter design

Implement working code that is production-grade, visually striking, and memorable.
